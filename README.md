## About


GMK Keycap Colors is a database that filters all 400+ keycaps made by GMK(Gunther, Meinhardt, and Kredler) into their corresponding color list and was made for the mechanical keyboard community. 

It features a simple and straightforward design, offers an organized index of GMK keycap sets designed by many talented designers, and was built using Kotlin and Android Studio for frontend & backend. Also utilizes matrixzj aka Matrix Zou's [github/website](https://matrixzj.github.io/docs/gmk-keycaps) to offer more details on the keycap sets! 


GMK Keycap Colors was originally designed with keyboard enthusiast in mind. There was never a website or application that specifically filtered GMK keycaps into a color category. Which was why this project was created, to stop the endless hours of searching for the perfect keycap set to match your board.
