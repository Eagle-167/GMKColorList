## About


GMK Color list is an app that filters all 400+ keycaps made by GMK(Gunther, Meinhardt, and Kredler) into their corresponding color and was made for the mechanical  keyboard community. 

It features a simple and straightforward design, offers an organized index of GMK keycap sets designed by many talented designers, and also utilizes matrixzj aka Matrix Zou's github/website to offer more details on the keycap sets! 

GMK Color list was originally designed with keyboard enthusiast in mind. There was never a website or application that specifically filtered GMK keycaps into a color category. Which was why this project was created, to stop the endless hours of searching for the perfect keycap set to match your board.
